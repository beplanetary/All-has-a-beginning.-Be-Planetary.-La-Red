All has a beginning. Be Planetary. La Red

To start a change we propose a new social network, Planetary.

It belongs to all its members.

It is a very simple idea and it is the base of our network: we must to give a equal grade to each one in this planet, what means persons and nature (animals, plants, elements and environments) like partners, and workers and companies like associateds, all of them are equals, have voice and vote, this is Neoequality.

You and your creativity (products, services, activities and contents) from a eco point of view, are the most valuable in this world. We help to generate more resources from it cross Planetary. This is Ecosufficiency.
